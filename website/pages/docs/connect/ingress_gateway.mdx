  how to use Envoy and describes how you can plug in a gateway of your choice.

-> **1.8.0+:**  This feature is available in Consul versions 1.8.0 and newer.

# Ingress Gateways

## Prerequisites

Ingress gateways also require that your Consul datacenters are configured correctly:

- You'll need to use Consul version 1.8.0.
- Consul [Connect](/docs/agent/options#connect) must be enabled in both datacenters.
- [gRPC](/docs/agent/options#grpc_port) must be enabled.

Currently, Envoy is the only proxy with ingress gateway capabilities in Consul.

## Running and Using an Ingress Gateway

The steps that need to occur for an Ingress Gateway to proxy traffic to services in the Consul mesh are as follows:

1. Run an envoy proxy using the [envoy subcommand](/docs/commands/connect/envoy), specifying the `ingress` gateway type.
2. Create an `ingress-gateway` [configuration entry](/docs/agent/config-entries/ingress-gateway) that defines a set of listeners that expose the desired backing services.
3. Ensure that [intentions](/docs/connect/intentions) are setup between the ingress gateway service and the backing services.
