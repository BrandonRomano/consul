  A Terminating Gateway enables traffic from services in the Consul

  how to use Envoy and describes how you can plug in a gateway of your choice.

-> **1.8.0+:**  This feature is available in Consul versions 1.8.0 and newer.

# Terminating Gateways

## Prerequisites

Terminating gateways also require that your Consul datacenters are configured correctly:

- You'll need to use Consul version 1.8.0.
- Consul [Connect](/docs/agent/options#connect) must be enabled in the datacenter.
- [gRPC](/docs/agent/options#grpc_port) must be enabled.

Currently, Envoy is the only proxy with terminating gateway capabilities in Consul.

## Running and Using a Terminating Gateway

The steps that need to occur for a terminating gateway to proxy traffic from services in the Consul mesh are as follows:

1. Run an envoy proxy using the [envoy subcommand](/docs/commands/connect/envoy), specifying the `terminating` gateway type.
2. Create a `terminating-gateway` [configuration entry](/docs/agent/config-entries/terminating-gateway) that defines 
a set of services that the gateway will proxy traffic to.
3. Ensure that [intentions](/docs/connect/intentions) are set up between the source services in the mesh 
and the services associated with the gateway.
