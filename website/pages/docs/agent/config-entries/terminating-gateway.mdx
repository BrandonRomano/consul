# Terminating Gateway

-> **1.8.0+:** This config entry is available in Consul versions 1.8.0 and newer.

  The `terminating-gateway` config entry kind allows for configuring terminating gateways
  to proxy traffic from services in the mesh to services outside the mesh.
  See [Terminating Gateway](/docs/connect/terminating_gateway) for more information.

## Wildcard service specification

  Terminating gateways can optionally target all services within a namespace by specifying a wildcard "*"
  as the service name. Configuration options set on the wildcard act as defaults that can be overridden
  by options set on a specific service name.

  Note that if the wildcard specifier is used, and some services in that namespace have a Connect sidecar proxy,
  traffic from the mesh to those services will be evenly load-balanced between the gateway and their sidecars. 

## Sample Config Entries

Associate a gateway with the billing service:

```hcl
kind = "terminating-gateway"
name = "us-west-gateway"
namespace = "default"
services = [
  {
    name = "billing"
  }
]
```

Associate a gateway with all services in the pci namespace, and verify destination
service certificates with a CA file for one-way TLS authentication:

```hcl
kind = "terminating-gateway"
name = "us-west-gateway"
namespace = "default"
services = [
  {
    namespace = "pci"
    name = "*"
    ca_file   = "/etc/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem"
  }
]
```

Associate a gateway with all services in the finance namespace, and configure default certificates for mutual TLS.
Also override the SNI and CA file used for connections to the billing service:

```hcl
kind = "terminating-gateway"
name = "us-west-gateway"
namespace = "finance"
services = [
  {
    name      = "*"
    ca_file   = "/etc/common-certs/ca-chain.cert.pem"
    key_file  = "/etc/common-certs/gateway.key.pem"
    cert_file = "/etc/common-certs/gateway.cert.pem"
  },
  {
    name      = "billing"
    ca_file   = "/etc/billing-ca/ca-chain.cert.pem"
    sni       = "billing.service.com"
  }
]
```

## Available Fields

- `Kind` - Must be set to `terminating-gateway`

- `Name` `(string: <required>)` - Set to the name of the gateway being configured.

- `Namespace` `(string: "default")` - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> Specifies the namespace 
    the config entry will apply to. If omitted, the namespace will be inherited from [the 
    request](/api/config#ns) or will default to the `default` namespace.

- `Services` `(array<LinkedService>: <optional>)` - A list of services to associate
    with the gateway. The gateway will proxy traffic to these services.

    - `Name` `(string: "")` - The name of the service to associate with the gateway.
    If the wildcard specifier, `*`, is provided, then ALL services within the namespace
    will be associated with the gateway.

    - `Namespace` `(string: "")` - <EnterpriseAlert inline /> The namespace of the service.
    If omitted, the namespace will be inherited from the config entry.

    - `CAFile` `(string: "")` - A file path to a PEM-encoded certificate authority.
    The file must be present on the proxy's filesystem.
    The certificate authority is used to verify the authenticity of the service associated with the gateway.
    It can be provided along with a CertFile and KeyFile for mutual TLS authentication, or on its own
    for one-way TLS authentication. If none is provided the gateway **will not** encrypt the traffic to the destination.

    - `CertFile` `(string: "")` - A file path to a PEM-encoded certificate.
    The file must be present on the proxy's filesystem.
    The certificate is provided servers to verify the gateway's authenticity. It must be provided if a KeyFile was specified.

    - `KeyFile` `(string: "")` - A file path to a PEM-encoded private key.
     The file must be present on the proxy's filesystem.
     The key is used with the certificate to verify the gateway's authenticity. It must be provided along if a CertFile was specified.

    - `SNI` `(string: "")` - An optional hostname or domain name to specify during the TLS handshake.

## ACLs

Configuration entries may be protected by
[ACLs](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/security-networking/production-acls).

Reading a `terminating-gateway` config entry requires `service:read` on the `Name`
field of the config entry.

Creating, updating, or deleting a `terminating-gateway` config entry requires
`operator:write`.
